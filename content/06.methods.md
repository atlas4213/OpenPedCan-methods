#### Data and code availability

Within OpenPedCan (OPC), we harmonized, aggregated, and analyzed data from multiple sources. 
We harmonized data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET cohort) Initiative, an NCI-funded collection of disease-specific projects that seeks to identify the genomic changes of pediatric cancers [@dbgap:phs000218.v23.p8]. 
We included already harmonized neuroblastoma samples from the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF cohort) Pediatric Research Program, a large-scale effort to accelerate research and gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects [@dbgap:phs001436.v1.p1].
Additionaly, OPC includes the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) Project data, an open science initiative led by Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation Childhood Cancer Data Lab and the Center for Data-Driven Discovery (D3B) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), which genomically characterized pediatric brain tumor data from the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN), and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-oncology Consortium (PNOC) [@dbgap:phs002517.v1.p1], [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340].
Finally, OPC includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) P30 Panel data generated by CHOP's Division of Genomic Diagnostics (DGD cohort) which includes fusion panel data [@dbgap:phs002517.v1.p1].
In addition to pediatric cancer data, OpenPedCan contains adult data from large science consortiums as references.
For normal gene expression, GTEx [@dbgap:phs000424.v9.p2] was used, and for comparison with adult cancers, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [@https://www.cancer.gov/tcga] was also included.

Merged summary files for OpenPedCan v12 are openly accessible in [CAVATICA](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/cavatica/opentarget) or via download script in the [https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis) repository.
Cancer group summary data are visible within the NCI's pediatric [Molecular Targets Platform](https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/) and cohort, cancer group, and individual data are visible within [PedcBioPortal](https://pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org/study/summary?id=openpedcan_v12)

OpenPedCan analysis modules were developed within OpenPBTA [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340], modified based on OpenPBTA, or newly created and can be found within the following publicly available repositories.
