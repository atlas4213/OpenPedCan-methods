#### Data and code availability

Within OpenPedCan (OPC), we harmonized, aggregated, and analyzed data from multiple sources. 
We harmonized data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET cohort) Initiative, an NCI-funded collection of disease-specific projects that seeks to identify the genomic changes of pediatric cancers [@dbgap:phs000218.v23.p8]. 
We included already harmonized neuroblastoma samples from the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF cohort) Pediatric Research Program, a large-scale effort to accelerate research and gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects [@dbgap:phs001436.v1.p1].
Additionally, we re-harmonized all samples from the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA, PBTA cohort), an open science initiative led by Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation Childhood Cancer Data Lab and the Center for Data-Driven Discovery (D3B) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), which genomically characterized pediatric brain tumor data from the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN), and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-oncology Consortium (PNOC) [@dbgap:phs002517.v1.p1; @doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340].
Building on the work of OpenPBTA, OPC added the PBTA X01 data [@https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/2021X01projects#FY21_Resnick], the Chordoma Foundation data [@https://www.chordomafoundation.org/], and the MI-ONCOSEQ Study [@https://www.pathology.med.umich.edu/mctp/mi-oncoseq-study], donated to CBTN by the University of Michigan, to the PBTA cohort.
Finally, OPC includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) P30 Panel data generated by CHOP's Division of Genomic Diagnostics (DGD cohort) which includes fusion panel data [@dbgap:phs002517.v1.p1].
In addition to pediatric cancer data, OpenPedCan contains adult data from large science consortiums as references.
For normal gene expression, GTEx [@dbgap:phs000424.v9.p2] was used, and for comparison with adult cancers, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [@https://www.cancer.gov/tcga] was included.

#### Methylation Analysis
##### Methylation array preprocessing
We preprocessed raw Illumina 450K and EPIC 850K Infinium Human Methylation Bead Array intensities using the array preprocessing methods implemented in the `minfi Bioconductor package` [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw691]. 
We utilized either `preprocessFunnorm` when an array dataset had both tumor and normal samples or multiple OpenPedcan-defined `cancer_groups` and `preprocessQuantile` when an array dataset had only tumor samples from a single OpenPedcan-defined `cancer_group` to estimate usable methylation measurements (`beta-values` and `m-values`) and copy number (`cn-values`). 
Some Illumina Infinium array probes targeting CpG loci contain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near or within the probe [@doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.496], which could affect DNA methylation measurements [@doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2202-0]. 
As the minfi preprocessing workflow recommends, we dropped probes containing common SNPs in dbSNP (minor allele frequency > 1%) at the CpG interrogation or the single nucleotide extensions.

Details of methylation array preprocessing are available in the [OpenPedCan methylation-preprocessing module](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/methylation-preprocessing).

##### Methylation beta-values summaries
We comprehensively summarized gene-level and isoform-level metrics for the methylation `beta-values` estimated by array preprocessing to provide insight into the variations in overall genomic DNA methylation levels observed across different pediatric tumors by computing CpG probe-level summary metrics in each cancer group within a cohort, including 1) `beta-values quantiles`, 2) `gene expression (TPM) and methylation (beta-values) correlation`, 3) `TPM median expression`, and 4) `transcript representation` - a proxy for percent isoform expression in a gene. 
In addition, each CpG probe was annotated with a gene feature to identify the genomic regions likely involved in regulating gene expression. 

Details of the analysis are available in the [OpenPedCan methylation-summary module](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/methylation-summary).

##### Methylation sample classification
We ran the [dkfz's brain classifier version 12.5](https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp/classifiers/11), a comprehensive DNA methylation-based classification of CNS tumors across all entities and age groups [@doi:10.1038/nature26000]. 
Unprocessed IDAT-files from the [Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN)](https://cbtn.org/) `Infinium Human Methylation EPIC (850k) BeadChip arrays` were used as input and the following information was compiled into the `histologies.tsv` file: `dkfz_v12_methylation_subclass` (predicted methylation subtype), `dkfz_v12_methylation_subclass_score` (classification score), `dkfz_v12_methylation_mgmt_status` (_MGMT_ methylation status), and `dkfz_v12_methylation_mgmt_estimated` (estimated _MGMT_ methylation fraction).



#### Gene Expression
The [`tumor-normal-differential-expression`](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/tumor-normal-differential-expression) module perfoms differential expression analyses for all sets of Disease (`cancer_group`) and Dataset (`cohort`) across all genes found in the `gene-expression-rsem-tpm-collapsed.rds` table. 
The purpose of this analysis is to highlight the correlation and understand the variability in gene expression in different cancer conditions across different histological tissues. 
For OpenPedCan v12 data release, this module performs expression analysis over 102 cancer groups across 52 histological tissues for all 54,346 genes found in the dataset. 
This analysis was performed on the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia HPC and was configured to use 96G of RAM per CPU, with one task (one iteration of expression analysis for each set of tissue and cancer group) per CPU (total 102*52=5304 CPUs) using the [R/DESeq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) package. 
Please refer to script `run-tumor-normal-differential-expression.sh` in the module for additional details on Slurm processing configuration. 
The same analysis can also be performed on CAVATICA, but requires further optimization.
The module describes the steps for CAVATICA set up, and scripts to publish an application on the portal. 
The required data files are also available publicly on CAVATICA under the [Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Open Access](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/cavatica/opentarget/files/#q?path=v12). 
Refer to the module for detailed description and scripts.

##### Gene Expression Summary Statistics
We generated RNA-Seq gene expression (TPM) summary statistics for independent tumor samples from the combined OpenPedCan gene expression matrices, including cancers from pediatric cohorts (`PBTA`, `GMKF`, and `TARGET`) and adult cancers from the `TCGA` cohort.
We grouped selected samples into two groups containing samples from a cancer group in either each cohort or all cohorts, and calculated `TPM means`, `standard deviations`, `gene-wise z-scores`, `group-wise z-scores`, and `ranks` for each group as described in the [OpenPedCan rna-seq-expression-summary-stats module](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/rna-seq-expression-summary-stats) in detail. 
The resulting `gene-wise` and `group-wise` summary statistics tables were annotated with `EFO` and `MONDO` disease codes associated with the cancer groups.


##### Gene fusion detection

### QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

##### Focal Copy Number Calling (`focal-cn-file-preparation` analysis module)
Please refer to the OpenPBTA manuscript for details on assignment of copy number status values to CNV segments, cytobands, and genes [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340]. 
We applied criteria to resolve instances of multiple conflicting status calls for the same gene and sample, which are described in detail in the [focal-cn-file-preparation](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/focal-cn-file-preparation) module. 
Briefly, we prioritized 1) non-neutral status calls, 2) calls made from dominant segments with respect to gene overlap, and 3) amplification and deep deletion status calls over gain and loss calls, respectively, when selecting a dominant status call per gene and sample. 
These methods resolved >99% of duplicated gene-level status calls.    


##### Gene Set Variation Analysis (`gene-set-enrichment-analysis` analysis module)

#### Prediction of participants' genetic sex
Please refer to the OpenPBTA manuscript for details [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340].


#### Selection of independent samples (`independent-samples` analysis module)

For analyses that require all input biospecimens to be independent, we use the OpenPedCan-analysis [independent-samples](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/d397339d567ddeff17e7a8cdca892f6a9dd2a0ba/analyses/independent-samples) module to select only one biospecimen from each input participant.
For each input participant of an analysis, the independent biospecimen is selected based on the analysis-specific filters and preferences for the biospecimen metadata, such as experimental strategy, cancer group, and tumor descriptor.
