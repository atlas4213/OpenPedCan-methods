##### Gather SNV and INDEL Hotspots

##### Consensus SNV Calling
<!-- TODO: needs update -->

We adopted the consensus SNV calling method described in OpenPBTA manuscript with adjustment ([@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340]). 
For SNV calling, we combined four consensus SNV calling algorithms, including Strelka2 ([@https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0051-x]), Mutect2, Lancet ([https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0023-9]), and VarDict ([@doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw227]).
Strelka2 outputs multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) as consecutive single-nucleotide polymorphisms
In order preserve MNPs, we gather MNP calls from the other caller inputs, and search for evidence supporting these consecutive SNP calls as MNP candidates
Once found, the Strelka2 SNP calls supporting a MNP are converted to a single MNP call
This is done to preserve the predicted gene model as accurately as possible in our consensus calls
Consensus SNV from all four callers were collected and by default, calls that were shown in at least two calling algorithms or marked as "HotSpotAllele" would be retained. 
Retained SNV were annotated by the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEF) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0974-4] and BCFtools [@https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008].
Final results were saved in MAF format.
