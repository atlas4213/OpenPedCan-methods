##### Gene Expression Matrices with Unique HUGO Symbols
<!-- TODO: needs update, include liftover for TCGA/GTEX -->
Among the data sources used for OpenPedCan, GTEx and TCGA used different versions of GENCODE. 
Moreover, the gene symbols used in these different GENCODE versions also varied. 
Therefore, the gene symbols had to be harmonized for compatibility to map unique gene identifiers to their gene symbols.
ENSG IDs from each data source were pulled and mapped to the GTF/GFF3 file from [`GENCODE v39`](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_39.html) to extract unique gene symbols and remove duplicates.
Additionally, the gene expression matrices had some instances where multiple Ensembl gene identifiers mapped to the same gene symbol.
This was dealt with by filtering the expression matrix to only genes with [FPKM/TPM] > 0 and then selecting the instance of the gene symbol with the maximum mean [FPKM/TPM/Expected_count] value across samples. 
This enabled many downstream modules that require RNA-seq data have gene symbols as unique gene identifiers.
